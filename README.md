# Wind-Speed-Predicting-Website

A website that can predict windspeed using deep learning model. This website generates two prediction results which are generated by two different deep learning model. Of the two models, one is LSTM and the other is GRU model.

For generating the prediction result, the models take in account 7 different user input values which are 'maximum temperature', 'minimum temperature', 'Rainfall', 'Relative Humidity', 'Cloud Coverage', 'UV ray amount'. These inputs are taken as form data and then fed to the model for predicting wind speed value.

The models were trained using a dataset of 65 years of Weather Data of Bangladesh having 18000 entries. After that they were tested on a separate dataset. GRU model showed testing accuracy of 98.80% where as LSTM model showed testing accuracy of 97.93%.

The models were integrated to the website using FLASK API.
